Thanks to my parents, who let me drag the old telescope out ot the driveway, and then didn't laugh at me when I decided I wanted to take pictures of the sky for a living; to Joe and Grandma Sue, who demand a one-sentence answer but get a ten-minute diatribe;

To my advisor, Christy, and to the other UW faculty who gave me the tools 

To Brianna, whose unwavering support has made the last 2 years much more fun that would have been otherwise possible;

To my late grandparents Zelson \& Pace; particularly to my grandfather Sidney Zelson, an academic who always told a joke; to his father, Louis Zelson, also a UW-Madison Ph.D;

To the Monday night trivia crowd (Chris, Greg, Nick, Arthur, Kendall, Bri, DK, and Catherine; with recent additions Erik, Rachel, Andrew, and Anthony; and occasional guest stars Melissa, Logan, Aaron, and Ben): thanks for the hangouts, knocking off early with me, and not letting me always guess Russia; and to the Sunday soccer crew: thanks for getting me on my feet \& moving;

To my grad school officemates Nick, Corey, Arthur, Ben, Catherine, and most of all Jacqueline \& Diego: thanks for answering my basic questions about other fields, listening to my complaints about my code being too slow, and telling me to go sail when I wasn't getting anything done anyway; and to my housemates past \& present

To my fellow students and friends, many named already, but especially DK, Diego, Julie, Jacqueline, Catherine, Kendall, and Matt: the community we have built together in adversity and success alike has gotten me through the most challenging moments;

To the people of the Ho-Chunk Nation, whose lands encompass the space where I have lived and studied
