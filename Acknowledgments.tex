Thanks to my parents, who let me drag the old telescope out ot the driveway, and then didn't laugh at me when I decided I wanted to take pictures of the sky for a living; to Joe and Grandma Sue, who demand a one-sentence answer but get a ten-minute diatribe; to Brianna, whose unwavering support has made the last 2 years much more fun that would have been otherwise possible.

To the Monday night trivia crowd (Chris, Greg, Nick, Arthur, Kendall, Bri, DK, and Catherine; with recent additions Erik, Rachel, Andrew, and Anthony; and occasional guest stars Melissa, Logan, Aaron, and Ben): thanks for the hangouts, knocking off early with me, and not letting me always guess Russia. Kevin, MJ, Gretchen, and Joel always pulled a mean pint for a guy in need, which never hurt.
