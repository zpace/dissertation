% Astronomy thesis DOCUMENT STYLE for LaTeX2e
%    -- See bottom for AASTeX -> thesis style conversion instructions
%
% Created: 1991: Siebers
%
% Modification History - 
%
%    July 1996, Eric Jensen -
%	Totally overhauled the style.  It was based on the Latex
%	``book'' style (and still is).  Before the whole file was
%	basically a copy of the Latex 2.09 book.sty file, with a few
%	things changed here and there.  Now we load the Latex2e book
%	class at the beginning, and then change only those things which
%	need to be changed (which turns out to be not very much).  A
%	modified version of the AASTeX style is loaded which defines
%	all of the commands and environments used there.
%
%	The ``thesis'' style now can be invoked with various options,
%	including type sizes (10pt, 11pt, 12pt), and with various
%	margins: ``draft'' gives smaller margins and line spacing,
%	suitable for handing to your committee but without using a
%	whole ream of paper; ``final'' conforms to the grad school
%	margin requirements and is suitable for the final copy.
%	Default is \documentclass[12pt,final]{thesis}.
%
%    July 1996, Andrea Cox:
%	Added a \fixspacing command you can use if you want to guarantee
%	  single-spaced figure and table captions in your final draft.
%	  Insert this command within the caption environments (see below).
%	Redefined the table spacing within the \draftsize and \finalsize
%	  commands, to ensure single-spacing of the table rows.  (See the
%	  "arraystretch" option.)
%
%    October 1997, Jerry Acord:
%     *     Added the "sflabels" to the pool of options available in the
%       document declaration.  If "sflabels" is invoked (in the same
%       manner one invokes "12pt", "draft", etc.), then the labelling
%       for the Chapters, Sections, Table of Contents, and the page
%       numbers is done in a sans serif font.  If "sflabels" is not 
%       invoked, then these labels are by default in the roman font, 
%       the same as the rest of the text (boring!!).
%     *     Changed the definition of "\addconentsline" so as to incorporate
%       \labelfamily ("sflabels") when generating the TOC.
%     *     Added the environment "chabstract" for abstracts associated
%       with individual chapters (e.g. if the chapters are actually
%       journal articles).  The "chabstract" is treated like a section
%       in the TOC, and in the "chabstract" itself the word "Abstract"
%       is somewhat smaller than in the true "abstract" environment.  
%       The "abstract" environment generates a chapter-like entry in 
%       the TOC.  Of course these things can be easily modified in this 
%       file.
%     *     Added the commands \ttlpage and \cpypage which when invoked
%       with a few commands will produce the title page and copyright
%       page automatically, without having to type in all the info
%       onesself.  See below for more info.
%     *     Added the "umiabstract" environment, which will produce the 
%       UMI abstract required by the graduate school.  Actually, you
%       have to produce it, this environment just formats it properly.
%       It requires \author, \title, \adviser, and \adviserrank, as well 
%       as the file name of your UMI abstract (less than 350 words!).
%       Note that \adviser should be of the form "Bob Dole", and 
%       \adviserrank is of the form "Professor".
%       Remember, the UMI abstract is _not_ part of your thesis!!!
%       USAGE: \begin{umiabstract} Abstract text \end{umiabstract}
%       (Ideally this is in a file separate from your master.tex file
%       for your thesis; it still REQUIRES the thesis document class!)
%
%   (Added "compact" option, so if you choose "compact" in place of
%   "final" or "draft," you'll end up with something that is single-
%   spaced and more suited for printing lots of copies e.g. to
%   distribute to your neighbors as sleeping aides.  It produces
%   something more like a preprint/reprint, rather than the double-
%   spaced crap that Memorial Library wants. 15 Dec. 1997 Jerry Acord)
%
%    December 1999, Peter Erwin:
%     *     Fixed copyright page format (invoked by \cpypage) to
%       better match Graduate School guideline; important change was
%       moving the year to the end of the copyright line.
%     *     Fixed UMI abstract (now called ``Bell & Howell'' abstract,
%       apparently, but the current forms still say UMI) -- killed
%       generation of page numbers by changing \thispagestyle{thesis}
%       to \thispagestyle{empty}.  Added an additional \this...{empty}
%       before the ``Advisor'' text in case abstract runs to two
%       pages, which it usually does; initial \this...{empty} only
%       works for the first page!
%     *     Note that Graduate School format requirements have
%       changed somewhat: 10 point type is now acceptable!
%       (12 pt type is still acceptable, of course, if you have
%       a strong desire to use up lots of paper.)
%     *     Desiderata: A really ambitious person might want to
%       adapt this style to make use of AASTeX version 5.0 macros,
%       so that future ApJ/AJ/etc. papers can be easily incorporated
%       into a thesis.  However, one probably wants to wait until
%       the bugs in v5.0 are fixed....
%
%    August 2000, Chris Dolan:
%       Added AASTeX V5.0-like citation commands
%       Added notes to the bottom of this file on how to convert a
%          AASTeX paper into a thesis chapter
%       Minor fix in \tablecomments
%       Tweaked compact style (Note: compact style still doesn't space
%          footnotes and tablenotes right.  I don't know how to fix
%          this...)
%
%    July 2001, Birgit Otte:
%       Added a command to ignore the \objectname[]{} command used by ApJ
%          for astronomical catalog databases
%
%    August 2008, Amanda Kepley:
%       Redefined float placement commands so that figures and tables
%       float more sensibly in the document.
%
%    December 2008, Kyle Westfall:
%	Replaced commented line to allow "Abstract" contents entries to be
%	    aligned with section heading instead of section number (also done for
%	    "References" in thesis_aasms.sty file)
%	Removed deluxetable package (uncomment line 240 to regain)
%
%    June 2011, Alex Hill:
%      Add labels to \listoffigures and \listoftables in compact mode
%
%   April 2015, Corey Wood:
%       - Tweaks to title page layout; mostly behind-the-scenes.
%       - Completely re-did margins to be just over 1 inch, with
%         page numbers ~0.6 inches from the top of the page.
%
%   April 2016, Chris Bard:
%       In conversion instructions:
%       - added infomation about bibliography complilation
%       - added infomation about short titles in Table of Contents,
%          list of tables, list of figures
%       - go Phillies!
%
%   June 2016, Chris Bard
%       At the end of this document
%       - Added details about epigraphs
%       - Added details about making list of symbols

%
% October 1997, Jerry Acord: I've found it necessary to change 
%   \thispagestyle to "thesis" from "plain" to ensure the page
%   numbers go in the upper right as required (and that they 
%   conform to \labelfamily just like all the other page numbers).
%
%   I commented out the entry for the (blank) section number of
%   the abstract; removing it justifies the "Abstract" title with
%   the chapter numbers on the left-hand margin.

% beginning of the manuscript.  This is particularly useful 
% if your chapters are actually journal articles with individual
% abstracts of their own.  Note that the \chabstract entry in 
% the table of contents appears as an unnumbered section, 
% whereas the \abstract appears as an unnumbered chapter.

%
% The page style 'foo' is defined by defining the command \ps@foo.  This
% command should make only local definitions.  There should be no stray
% spaces in the definition, since they could lead to mysterious extra
% spaces in the output.
%
% The \ps@... command defines the macros \@oddhead, \@oddfoot,
% \@evenhead, and \@evenfoot to define the running heads and
% feet---e.g., \@oddhead is the macro to produce the contents of the
% heading box for odd-numbered pages.  It is called inside an \hbox of
% width \textwidth.
%
% To make headings determined by the sectioning commands, the page style
% defines the commands \chaptermark, \sectionmark, ... , where
% \chaptermark{TEXT} is called by \chapter to set a mark, and so on.
% The \...mark commands and the \...head macros are defined with the
% help of the following macros.  (All the \...mark commands should be
% initialized to no-ops.)
%
% MARKING CONVENTIONS:
% LaTeX extends TeX's \mark facility by producing two kinds of marks
% a 'left' and a 'right' mark, using the following commands:
%     \markboth{LEFT}{RIGHT} : Adds both marks.
%     \markright{RIGHT}      : Adds a 'right' mark.
%     \leftmark  : Used in the \@oddhead, \@oddfoot, \@evenhead or \@evenfoot
%                  macro, gets the current 'left'  mark.  Works like TeX's
%                  \botmark command.
%     \rightmark : Used in the \@oddhead, \@oddfoot, \@evenhead or \@evenfoot
%                  macro, gets the current 'right'  mark.  Works like TeX's
%                  \firstmark command.
% The marking commands work reasonably well for right marks 'numbered
% within' left marks--e.g., the left mark is changed by a \chapter command and
% the right mark is changed by a \section command.  However, it does
% produce somewhat anomalous results if two \bothmark's occur on the same page.
%
% Commands like \tableofcontents that should set the marks in some page styles
% use a \@mkboth command, which is \let by the pagestyle command (\ps@...)
% to \markboth for setting the heading or \@gobbletwo to do nothing.

\mark{{}{}}   % Initializes TeX's marks

%        How to convert a AASTeX 5.0 paper into a thesis chapter        %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  (Note changing a AASTeX 4.0 paper to thesis style requires nearly
%  identical steps)
%
%  * Change paper title -> chapter title:
%        \title{text} -> \chapter[text]{text}
%           (the two versions in \chapter are for what shows up in the
%           table of contents vs. what shows up at the start of the
%           chapter)
%
%  * Optional: Label the chapter   e.g. \label{ch2}
%
%  * Optional: Define a \FigDir (only if you are using the \figcaption
%        macro that CJD created
%
%  * Remove header stuff:
%        \documentclass (or \documentstyle for old papers)
%        \begin{document}
%        \slugcomment
%        \author, \affil, \email, \shortauthors, \shorttitle, etc
%        \keywords
%
%  * Optional: Move the \newcommand{}s to define.tex
%
%  * Optional: Move \usepackage{}s to Thesis.tex and delete in chapter
%
%  * Change \begin{abstract} -> \begin{chabstract}  (ditto for \end{})
%
%  * Optional: change all citations and references to have, for
%        example, ``ch1'' in them.  That is, \citet{dol00} ->
%        \citet{ch1:dol00}.  This is to prevent instances of
%        ``Citation multiply defined'' or (even worse) a section
%        number multiply defined (i.e., what happens if you have
%        \label{sec:discussion} in both Chapters 1 & 2 and then you
%        have a \ref{sec:discussion} in Chapter 3?  Better to have
%        \ref{ch2:discussion}, I say)
%
%  * Move figures to their appropriate places in the text (usually
%        where you put the \placefigure{}s eariler)
%
%  * Put \fixspacing in every figure caption, and add short captions for the figures to go in the list of figures
%
%  * Define short titles for each figure/table
%    (they will show up in List of Tables/Figures)
%   ex: \caption[short title goes here]{\fixspacing Longer caption...}
%
%  * Input subdirectories in path for each chapter (AAK, 8/2/08)
%
%  * Put \fixspacing in every footnote
%
%  * Change \appendix to \chapappendix and add \endchapappendix
%
%  * Fix tables:
%        - Put \fixspacing in every \tablenotetext
%        - Remove the \rotate commands and put \begin{landscape} and
%          \end{landscape around the \begin,\end{deluxetable} commands
%          where needed
%        - Take out \tabletypesize{\scriptsize} (AAK, 8/2/08)
%
%  * Remove footer stuff:
%        \end{document}
%           (Note if you forget to do this you will get a very
%           mysterious error message like:
%           \end occurred when \iftrue on line 85 was incomplete)
%
%  * If references/citations do not work for you when compiling Thesis.tex
%     with whatever LaTeX editor you use, you may have to manually create
%     each chapter's .bbl file with BibTex.
%    Process:
%      1. latex/pdftex/etc. Thesis.tex 
%          -> will produce .aux files for each chapter
%      2. in Chap# directory, ln -s ../thesis.bst
%         -> creates symbolic link to bibliography style file
%      3. in Chap# directory, bibtex chap#.aux
%         -> creates chap#.bbl file
%      4. latex/pdftex/etc. Thesis.tex (repeat as needed)
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Other miscellanea
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%    If you have so many equations and symbols floating around that
%     you actually run out of Greek letters to use, a table of symbols
%     would be greatly appreciated by your committee.
%
%    To do this, use the nomenclature package (nomencl) and in Thesis.tex,
%      - uncomment the \makenomenclature 
%      - uncomment \renewcommand{\nomlabel}[1]{\hfil #1\hfil}
%      - uncomment \renewcommand{\nomname}{List of Abbreviations and Symbols}
%      - uncomment \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{List of Selected Abbreviations and Symbols}
%      - uncomment {\fixspacing \small
%                  \printnomenclature[1in]
%                  }
%
%       or else just put these lines in! 
%       usepackage and makenomenclature go before begin{document}
%       the rest go after \listoffigures and before \mainmatter
%
%       In order to properly compile, you need to:
%        - pdflatex (or whatever)
%        - makeindex Thesis.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o Thesis.nls
%        - pdflatex
%
%%%%%%%%
%
%      If you want to have epigraphs, use the epigraph package!
%       \epigraph{bon mot, \textit{format it too!}}{clever person}
%
%      These go after \chapter and before \cleardoublepage
