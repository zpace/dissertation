\label{chap3:apdx:statement_of_work}

Here are briefly outlined the contributions of all listed authors for this publication, in order of their listing in the journal article.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Zachary J. Pace}: Initiated the mutual comparison of HI fraction, metallicity profile slope, and dispersion of the local metallicity distribution; proposed flexible azimuthal spaxel cuts \& the use of metallicity decrements in disk coordinates; devised the gaseous inflow explanation, and computed the effects of dilution on ISM metallicities; also led the writing of this manuscript.
    \item \textbf{Christy Tremonti}: Provided input on gaseous inflow scenario \& ensuing dilution; suggested methods of vetting decrements versus previous work; proposed targeting likely inflow hosts for HI follow-up; feedback on visualization; proofreading and revisions.
    \item \textbf{Adam L. Schaefer}: Contributed analysis of likely inflow metallicity based on equilibrium model, in the fashion of previously-published work; proofreading and revisions
    \item \textbf{David V. Stark}: Contributed correlation analysis accounting for gas fraction upper-limits; participated in HI observations at Green Bank Telescope; reduced HI observations; proofreading and revisions.
    \item \textbf{Catherine A. Witherspoon}: Contributed to gas profile discussion; proofreading and revisions.
    \item \textbf{Karen L. Masters}: Leader of HI-MaNGA follow-up program;  participated in HI observations at Green Bank Telescope; proofreading and revisions.
    \item \textbf{Remaining authors} (Niv Drory, Kai Zhang): Inclusion as Sloan Digital Sky Surveys Architects due to contributions to hardware, administration, survey science or software.
