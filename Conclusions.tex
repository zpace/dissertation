\chapter{Discussion, Summary, and Conclusions}

The chemical evolution of galaxies arises due to a confluence of dark matter halo collapse, star-formation, gas expulsion, and likely rejuvenation of star-forming gaseous reservoirs. The result is exquisite correlations between properties of halos, the galaxies embedded within them, and even individual regions within those galaxies. The works above have sought to measure the properties (particularly the mass) of the stars, the quantity of metals in the ISM, and their mutual relationship with the gaseous reservoir.
