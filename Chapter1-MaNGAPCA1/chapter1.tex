\begin{chabstract}
We present a method of fitting optical spectra of galaxies using a basis set of six vectors obtained from principal component analysis (PCA) of a library of synthetic spectra of 40000 star formation histories (SFHs). Using this library, we provide estimates of resolved effective stellar mass-to-light ratio ($\Upsilon^*$) for thousands of galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA integral-field spectroscopic survey. Using a testing framework built on additional synthetic SFHs, we show that the estimates of \logml{i} are reliable (as are their uncertainties) at a variety of signal-to-noise ratios, stellar metallicities, and dust attenuation conditions. Finally, we describe the future release of the resolved stellar mass-to-light ratios as a SDSS-IV/MaNGA Value-Added Catalog (VAC) and provide a link to the software used to conduct this analysis\footnote{\fixspacing\label{footnote:software_link}The software can be found at \url{https://github.com/zpace/pcay}, and the VAC (including a full datamodel and link to the latests data) at \url{https://www.sdss.org/dr16/data_access/value-added-catalogs/?vac_id=manga-pca-vac}.}
